### Info regarding the branch(deepenCore)

* This branch is all about deepening the core module functionality
* Means in the commits made in this branch i've added more functionalities like DataChannelManager and hence deepened the core module
* More specifically, in this branch, i've written classes that manage state,i.e, StateManagement oriented

**State Management**
* Consider a scenario where a user clicks an _interactive component_ of the app
* (This is the current _initial state_ of the app)
* A corresponding output/change is then reflected on the screen
* Technically speaking, that reflected change is termed as a _state change_
* (State here has got no special meaning, it is just what it is normally)
* The process that occurs down the architecture lane behind the scenes to cause the change reflected on the screen is handled by _stateManagement_
